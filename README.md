**Her Canvas Feed**


Her Canvas Read is a web platform designed by women, for women—a curated digital space that brings together empowering articles, practical advice, and community discussion in a beautiful Flipboard-style layout. Whether you’re a new mom, an ambitious freelancer, or just looking for authentic content that speaks to you, Her Canvas Read offers a personalized, engaging experience centered entirely on women’s lives.



The homepage shows a grid of articles across topics like Health, Career, Motherhood, and Lifestyle. Articles are presented with an easy scroll, tap, and explore option. Each story includes a quick read preview, clean imagery, and a one-click read-more experience. Users can like, share, or bookmark articles to return to later in their personal space.

There’s a Forum section where users can ask questions, write reviews, and support one another with lived experiences.

I’ll build it using Spring Boot, Java, MySQL, and TypeScript (not sure about this) with a lightweight HTML/CSS frontend. APIs will fetch fresh content, and the layout will automatically adjust to device screens.



Her Canvas Read is where women scroll with purpose. It’s inspiration, information, and sisterhood—all in one.
