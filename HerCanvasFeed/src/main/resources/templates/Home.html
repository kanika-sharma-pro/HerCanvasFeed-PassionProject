            <h3>What’s Next for Women’s Health in 2025? 5 Trends That Are Driving The Sector</h3>
            <p>Women’s health is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Historically overlooked, downplayed, and neglected, investors have spotted the largely untapped opportunity the sector presents. Venture capital investment in the women’s health sector has surged by 314% over the past five years, and despite the recent slowdown in startup funding, mid-year data shows the sector is on track for another record-breaking year.

            <h3>What Will The Next 20 Years In Health And Wellness Look Like?</h3>
            <p>he year is 2045. Perhaps that makes you middle-aged, but people aren’t calling it that anymore. Maybe we’re measuring age internally—assessing your biological age based on the vitality of your cells, for example, not the number of candles on your birthday cake. Or we’re gauging age by healthspan (years feeling fully alive), not lifespan (years being alive).
                In a particularly gracious version of this future world, aging is supported by health-care professionals who take, and treat, women’s pain seriously.</p>

            <p>Bringing a new baby home is an exciting time. But it can also feel overwhelming, stressful, and exhausting. “You’re healing from childbirth while getting to know your newborn,” says Hilary Baxendale, a childbirth educator and doula in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY.

                To help you get through those first few weeks, parents share their hard-earned lessons and favorite tips.</p>

            <p>Many of us find ourselves struggling to “balance” work and mom life. Between the invisible load, the pressure to work as if we don’t have children and mother as if we don’t work, and becoming the default parent to take off for sick days, there are a lot of challenges to maintaining a career as a parent. </p>

            <h3>How to dress over 50</h3>
            <p>Hitting your half century feels like a good time to reassess a few things. From careers to relationships, the Gransnet Talk Forums will have you covered if you fancy making some changes. But how about fashion over 50? While you may have had a clear sense of style in your younger years, different life stages bring other factors into the mix. Menopause and shifts in body shape can mean that outfits which worked at 30 or 40 don’t feel right for you now.</p>

            <h3>Rising Asian American Women Artists to Watch</h3>
            <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when it was not unusual to wonder where all the Asian American artists were. This curiosity led Kathy Huang to curate a group exhibition for gallery Jeffrey Deitch, where she’s managing director. Initially, she worried that finding 30 artists would be too big a task. She was wrong. The exhibition opened in May 2022 in New York, before traveling to Los Angeles.</p>
